# Sirius 2018

I've been a mentor in Sirius Summer Camp in 2018.
My task was to guide a group of students,
help them understand the most important aspects of ML.
The primary goal was to create and present the final project.

## Project

**Plant Seedling Recognition ()**: we have created a site,
which helps to recognize 12 types of seedlings and also
can determine the stage of their growth.

## Content

Here I store lectures, that I've hosted & some other materials.
