Here I store notebooks that I've shown on the seminars.

1. [Numpy Homework.ipynb](Numpy%20Homework.ipynb) - notebook with simple task on numpy which should help students to became familiar with numpy.

2. [Gradient Descent.ipynb](Gradient%20Descent.ipynb) - notebook with explanations on themes like derivatives, partial derivatives, gradient and gradient descent.

3. [Gradient Descent Homework.ipynb](Gradient%20Descent%20Homework.ipynb) - homework assignment which should help students to understand gradient descent.

And also there are some notes on different themes.
