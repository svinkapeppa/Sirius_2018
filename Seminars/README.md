Here I store notebooks that I've shown on the seminars.

1. [Numpy Homework.ipynb](Numpy%20Homework.ipynb) - notebook with simple tasks on numpy which should help students to became familiar with numpy.

2. [Gradient Descent.ipynb](Gradient%20Descent.ipynb) - notebook with explanations on themes like derivatives, partial derivatives, gradient and gradient descent.

3. [Gradient Descent Homework.ipynb](Gradient%20Descent%20Homework.ipynb) - homework assignment which should help students to understand gradient descent.

4. [SGD Homework.ipynb](SGD%20Homework.ipynb) - homework assignment which should help students to understand stohastic gradient descent.

And also there are some notes on different themes.

1. [Slides notes.pdf](Slides%20notes.pdf) - some pieces of advice for upcoming project defense.

I've created simple [kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/multiclassification). Datasets lies [here](csv/.).

1. [Preparation.ipynb](Preparation.ipynb) - notebook which I used to create competition, data and etc.

2. [Baseline.ipynb](Baseline.ipynb) - notebook which shows students how to solve competition.
